# ARIF
"Its FIRA spelled backwards"

ARIF is a way to learn how to use computer vision to make robots move. We are using OpenCV in Python for the computer vision part, and V-REP simulation software to simulate the robot. 


How to start:
1. Download and install V-REP simulation software from http://www.coppeliarobotics.com/downloads.html 
Choose either V-REP PLAYER (no saving capability) or V-REP PRO EDU (if you are from an educational institution)

2. Install Python and OpenCV
Easy way:
i. Download this WinPython distribution, which has been pre-installed with OpenCV and all the required modules:
https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8yF3X8Meb65b3ZabFBPcTNiLVk/view?usp=sharing

Harder way:
i. Download and install Python https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/ 
ii. Download and install OpenCV http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_setup/py_setup_in_windows/py_setup_in_windows.html#install-opencv-python-in-windows 

3. Get the files
Click the above green "Clone or download" button to get the files to run ARIF. 
Either "Open in Desktop" to clone into your computer, or download the current release by clicking "Download ZIP".
